# Dissertation-code

Repo to store the code used for my undergraduate projects. Studying spin glasses and their relation to energy based neural networks.

## Files
ising_model.py: Simulation of 2D square lattice Ising model implemented using the metropolis - hastings algorithm. Uses live animations to show spin configurations then plots magnetisation, energy, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature. Need to clean up the code and probably move plotting functions into another script for better readability.

bam.py: Simple implementation of a bidirectional associative memory model, a type of recurrent neural network. Used to store and retireve binary patterns. Simple case of a Hopfield network.
